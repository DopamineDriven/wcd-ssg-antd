TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript. It has become an increasingly popular tool for development environments, particularly in team settings. This is because TypeScript implements strict type checking and requires that type annotations be called in many scenarios (a feature not supported by Vanilla JavaScript). Unlike JavaScript, it won't launch and allow a subtle error to persist. On the contrary, TypeScript disallows the program from launching locally if an error is detected. Its intellisense is far superior to that of JavaScript's as well. This makes the process of debugging relatively painless and prevents bugs from snowballing into something truly catastrophic.
