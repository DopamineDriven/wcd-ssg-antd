## Ant design

The light-speed iteration of the digital world makes products more complex. However, human consciousness and attention resources are limited. Facing this design contradiction, the pursuit of natural interaction will be the consistent direction of Ant Design.

### The importance of UI/UX

- Natural user cognition: According to cognitive psychology, about 80% of external information is obtained through visual channels. The most important visual elements in the interface design, including layout, colors, illustrations, icons, etc., should fully absorb the laws of nature, thereby reducing the user's cognitive cost and bringing authentic and smooth feelings. In some scenarios, opportunely adding other sensory channels such as hearing, touch can create a richer and more natural product experience.

- Natural user behavior: In the interaction with the system, the designer should fully understand the relationship between users, system roles, and task objectives, and also contextually organize system functions and services. At the same time, a series of methods such as behavior analysis, artificial intelligence and sensors could be applied to assist users to make effective decisions and reduce extra operations of users, to save users' mental and physical resources and make human-computer interaction more natural.

- User certainty: User's daily work is completed through the collaboration of enterprise products. In addition to considering the consistency of a single product design, good certainty is required to be maintained across products, terminals, and systems. Consistent appearance and interaction, maintaining a familiarity to user, can reduce the difficulty of learning, cognitive and operating costs, and improve work efficiency.

- Value connection: The growth of products depends on the expansion and deep use of users, while the growth of users depends on the growth of product functions. By understanding the value of product function, we can explore user needs in different scenarios, and establish a connection between value and needs. Let product value be discovered and help users build more effective and efficient ways of working.

- Man-Computer Symbiosis: More connections between product functions and user requirements make human-computer interaction closer and users and system are growing together. When designing products, users and systems should not be separated from each other. They should be considered as a dynamic group to ensure that they are flexible, inclusive and full of vitality.
